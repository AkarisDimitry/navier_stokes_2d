# navier_stokes_2d
Project Title: 2D Incompressible Navier-Stokes Solver

Description:
This project provides a Python implementation of a 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes solver using the finite difference method. The Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of fluid substances, and this solver allows for the simulation and analysis of fluid flow behavior.

Key Features:
- Solves the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations numerically using the finite difference method.
- Supports arbitrary domain sizes and grid resolutions.
- Accounts for fluid viscosity and density to accurately simulate real-world flow behavior.
- Provides visualization capabilities to observe and analyze the fluid flow patterns.
- Includes options for saving simulation results as animations or images.
- Utilizes Numba for just-in-time compilation to optimize performance.

Usage:
1. Initialize the necessary parameters such as fluid density, viscosity, grid spacing, time step, and domain size.
2. Set the initial conditions for velocity and pressure fields.
3. Call the `navier_stokes_2d` function, providing the required parameters to solve the Navier-Stokes equations and obtain the updated velocity and pressure fields.
4. Visualize the results using the provided visualization functions or by customizing the code as per your requirements.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Numba (for optional performance optimization)
